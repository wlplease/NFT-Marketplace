Basic NFT Marketplace End to End
This code is for the NFT Marketplace project built by wlplease.

To set up the repository and run the marketplace locally, follow the steps below:

bash
Copy code
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/wlplease/NFT-Marketplace.git

# Navigate into the project directory
cd NFT-Marketplace

# Install the dependencies
yarn install

# Start the development server
yarn start
This will clone the repository to your local machine, install all necessary dependencies using Yarn, and start the development server. The application should now be running locally, and you can access it in your browser.
